Doing research on what I think is a National Semicondutor DM958, and wanting to find a proper schematic symbol for KiCad.

According to the 1976_National_TTL_Databook at http://www.bitsavers.org/components/national/_dataBooks/1976_National_TTL_Databook.pdf
It's a 

"Quad 2-Input Power Gates"

And apparently is equivalent with a Fairchild 9158, for which I don't even know how to find a datasheet for.

Trying to find an equivalent, When google-searching 7400 series Quad 2-Input Power Gates I get a 7400 Quad 2-Input NAND Gate

Comparing the logic symbol with a 7400 chip, it appears that they are mostly the same, BUT 
Pins 6 & 4 are swapped
and
Pins 10 & 8 are swapped

And the 7400 is called a Quad 2-Input NAND Gate
not a Quad 2-Input POWER Gate
even though they look by the symbols that they do the same thing logically.  

So, are these errors in the datasheets that I'm digging up, or are these chips really not quite the same thing?
