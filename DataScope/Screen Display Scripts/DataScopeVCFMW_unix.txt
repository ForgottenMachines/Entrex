                WELCOME TO 
            FORGOTTEN MACHINES
              AT VCFMW 2023


    THE ENTREX 480 SYSTEM IS CALLED A 

              "KEY-TO-DISK" 
                 SYSTEM

 IT WAS DESIGNED TO REPLACE PUNCHCARDS 
 FOR ENTERING DATA INTO A MAINFRAME.
 THE BENEFIT?  UNLIKE PUNCHCARDS, THE
 OPERATOR CAN SEE AND EDIT THE DATA 
       THEY ARE ENTERING ON THE 
  "NIFTY LITTLE TELEVISION SCREEN"
  THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
 YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH PUNCHCARDS.

       THE ENTREX 480 RUNS ON A 
DATA GENERAL NOVA CLONE MANUFACTURED BY 
      DIGITAL COMPUTER CONTROLS
           MODEL DCC D-116E 

THE "TERMINAL" YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS NOT
ACTUALLY A TERMINAL...IT'S CALLED A 

               "KEYSTATION"

            WHICH IS NAMED THE 

            "ENTREX DATA/SCOPE"


THESE KEYSTATIONS ALSO DO NOT USE 
SERIAL OR RS232 PROTOCOL. NOT EVEN CLOSE
THEY USE "MODIFIED MANCHESTER" USING 
SEVEN (7) SEPARATE WIRES.  

2 WIRES FOR DATA TO THE HOST SYSTEM
2 WIERES FOR DATA ON THE SCREEN
3 WIRES FOR COORDINATING COMMUNICATION

YOU MAY ALSO NOTICE THAT EVERY CHARACTER
ON THIS SCREEN IS UPPER CASE, 
LIKE I'M YELLING AT YOU.  
THAT'S ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS KEYSTATION
DOES NOT SUPPORT LOWER-CASE LETTERS...
SO UPPER CASE IS ALL YOU GET  =) =) =)
