Plastiform Magnetic Viewer, or B-1022 Magnetic Viewer, still available for $150-$175.  The video in question has a FAQ where he claims to have tried it on a floppy, with no results.  He states this, but does not show it in a video.  I am planning on getting one of these viewers when budget allows, and creating a video showing exactly what you say.  
Very astute comment, thank you!
