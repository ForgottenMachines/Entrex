@quantx @martyg4848 @nevets01 OK, I've been racking my brain on this, the Nova addressing / command operation is still rather hard for me to get my head around.  So, from best I can tell, it appears that the Entrex front panel does 4 operations in rapid succession:  
1 Reset
2 Examine
3 Deposit
4 Start

BUT, how it's communicating the address that it's examining, and data it's depositing to that address in steps 2 & 3 are still a bit of a mystery.



@quantx @martyg4848 @nevets01 @commodoreZ OK, I've been racking my brain on this, the Nova addressing / command operation is still rather hard for me to get my head around.  This is regarding a standard Nova 1200 front panel:

Am I correct in understanding that the /MEM0-15 lines are connected by the 0-15 selection switches to the /CON DATA line to tell the CPU what address to examine when the Examine switch is pressed?

And then is it exactly the same switches, also connecting to the /CON DATA line to tell the CPU what data to deposit in the "current address" when the Deposit switch is pressed?

OK, if those things are true, then when either the Examine or Deposit switches are pressed, the front panel also sends a "code" to the CPU over the same MEM0-7 lines, while asserting /CON RQ, is this also correct?

So, if all this is correct, then the timing must be very tricky to get right.

What is the order of signals that go high/low in order to execute all of this correctly?  

For reference, here's my aggregated collection of all front panel schematics:


Thanks for helping me understand this, guys!






HOW does the 

It seems like it's using the same lines for both the address/data AND the command bits
